- lmao this is the best meme ever, mind if i share it to my family?
- this is actually super clever ðŸ‘ŒðŸ˜‚
- hmm i see the same pics
- one is far more dangerous and virulent (and is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands). the other is coronavirus.
- was this one of those peaceful protests?
- neckk
- meh, both are diseases.
- halarious!
- i love how you people just completely ignore the thousands of people protesting for months bow
- stay in your basement if you are scared of a little virus.
- "haha please laugh" -u/erola1
- you gonna look silly when trump wins
- look at all the antifa infiltrators!
- if you've actually been to or seen a protest you'd know that everyone wears masks. everyone. they care about others, that's why they're protesting. the trumpers can't wait to gather for their cult leader while endangering everyone around them with infection. not a mask in sight.
- they're not all blm protestors though. [https://www.yahoo.com/huffpost/boogaloo-bois-minneapolis-precinct-antifa-134407613.html](https://www.yahoo.com/huffpost/boogaloo-bois-minneapolis-precinct-antifa-134407613.html)
- what if instead of a "little virus" i'm concerned about a huge pandemic that's killed over a million people and isn't slowing down in areas where people are too stupid to take basic precautions?
- that "little virus" has killed a close family friend of mine. sit down.
- and laugh i did.
- you were saying?
- **oh how the tables have turned**
- well well well, look what we have here
- "so much antifa! they just wanna make us look bad!" "hank isn't that you in the front row?" "its antifa dressing up like me to make me look bad!"
- "but they wear masks so it's okay!" good, now vote in person and reopen the schools, just have a mask on.
- which equates to 0.01% of the world population.
- i know it looks bad now, but just u have patience young grasshopper
- japan never went into lockdown. all they did was have essentially everyone wear masks. period. but masks became a subject of debate for some reason in this country. mask wearing has always been a necessary requirement for beating the virus
- 1) i'm not sure if you don't know the world population, don't know how many people died, or can't do math 2) ..."yet". the deadly virus is still picking up steam because morons refuse to take known precautions to deter it. at one point it was 0.01%, and at one yet earlier point it was 0.000001%. that number keeps growing and will continue to grow until we do something about it. 3) we both have failed to bring up the tens of million who are suffering (or may yet suffer) long term effects of this deadly virus. i have a few friends who still cannot taste nor smell anything despite being "cured". i have many friends who survived but are suffering because loved ones of their did not. i have one friend who got it, was cured (tested negative), and has now contracted it a second time months later. it's amazing that your eight words can display such complete and utter ignorance. i do feel that trump supporters should have the right to kill themselves off if they so wish, however sadly it's not that simple. when they contract this deadly virus that has killed 1m+ people, then spread it to people who have largely been taking necessary precautions because they would prefer *not* to die, then that is when action needs to be taken. any lawyer will tell you, "your rights end at the tip of my nose", and when your idiocy may cause a deadly virus to penetrate that boundary, then you should be held accountable.
- you were saying?
- this aged like fine wine.
- yes.
- i wear a mask but i do not think it is as effective as everyone says.. the people i know who got the virus all wore masks at all times.. the virus is smaller than the microscopic openings (holes) in your mask. its like putting up burglar bars to keep the mosquitoes away.
- piss off. this thing is a plan from china to get him to lose the election, once he wins it will disappear forever. i don't know anyone who has got it, i've been trying to get it for the last 6 months, but no success ðŸ˜• that's because it is over hyped ðŸ˜£ over hyped as fuck. i'll get the flu before i get this bat flu ðŸ¦‡ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. if you are scared of this plandemic, you should stay at home and the normal people will resume service as normal ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜˜.
- no, its like wearing a mask to prevent an airborne disease from spreading. you have to take additional measures. nobody said masks are the only solution
- you have to have friends in order to know people who've contracted it, i suppose, and if you have indeed been "trying to get it" then you've already called out your own (lack of) intelligence. to date i haven't heard any news in the media of any sheep contracting the virus, so if you're "trying" to contract the virus you may wish to diversify a little. if you think that this is a plan for the chinese to get rid of trump, then trump must be complicit starting from the day he went on camera and announced he was eliminating our early response team in china. by the way, i should also inform you, man did land on the moon, elvis is dead, and the earth is not flat.
- "i don't know anyone who has it so it must be fake" is such a stupid argument it's like if i said "i don't know anyone who's been to space so space must not exist" this is sadly the mindset that many americans have embraced. i hope you see the light.
- how are you this fucking dumb
- how's that "after the election it will disappear" thing going? asking for a friend.
- i distance aswell (mostly)
- [removed]
- 3 months after being informed isn't "so early". just saying.
