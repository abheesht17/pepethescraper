TEXT: 
- about anarcho-capitalism, often abbreviated as ancap, is a libertarian political philosophy promoting individual freedoms, private property and free markets through the removal of state governments. as a right-wing branch of anarchism, ancap is distinct from traditional left-wing branches that are typically associated with communist, syndicalist and mutualist economic theories. online, ancap-themed web comics often use black and yellow colors taken from the swedish anarkokapitalistisk front flag.
