TEXT: 
- about picardia, also known as strawman ball or memeball, is a series of image macros featuring a 3d illustration of a smiley face making a thumbs-up gesture. while initially popularized on the argentinian website taringa, customized versions of the character mocking a variety of political ideologies began circulating on 4chan in august 2016.
- origin picardia was originally taken from emotiguy,[1] an app for designing emojis. in 2014, picardia began circulating on taringa, where it was open captioned various spanish language in-jokes (shown below).[2] the character was subsequently nicknamed picardia ("mischievous" in spanish) on the internet humor site.[3]
- spread on december 8th, 2015, an english language version of the image macro was posted in a thread on 4chan's /int/ (international) board (shown below).[4] in august 2016, variations of the image using the yellow and black colors from the swedish anarkokapitalistisk front flag began circulating on reddit[5] and 4chan,[6] featuring captions mocking anarcho-capitalism (shown below). shortly after, additional variations of the smiley face began appearing on 4chan, with each customized to mock stereotypes associated with other political ideologies (shown below). [7] on november 20th, a thread referring to the images as "strawman ball" was posted on 4chan's /pol/ board,[8] where many users replied with variations of the image macro (shown below). the name is based off the straw man informal fallacy, in which a misrepresented version of an argument is refuted in a debate. the following day, a similar thread was posted on /pol/.[7] notable examples
